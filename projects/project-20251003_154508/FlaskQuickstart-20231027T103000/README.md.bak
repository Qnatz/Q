# FlaskQuickstart-20231027T103000

This is a simple Flask application demonstrating basic routing and templating.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Flask Application

Ensure your virtual environment is active and then run the application.

```bash
flask run
```

The application should now be running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or a similar address displayed in your terminal).

### 5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

```bash
deactivate
```
