# FlaskFlow-20231027T103000 Project Setup

This document outlines the initial steps to set up the project directory and Python virtual environment.

## 1. Create the Project Directory (if not already done)

First, navigate to the parent directory where you wish to create `FlaskFlow-20231027T103000`, then execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir FlaskFlow-20231027T103000
cd FlaskFlow-20231027T103000
```

## 2. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

From within the `FlaskFlow-20231027T103000` directory, create a virtual environment named `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

*   **Note:** Depending on your system configuration, you might need to use `python` instead of `python3`.

## 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

After creating the `venv` directory, activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system:

*   **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
source venv/bin/activate
    ```

*   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
vend\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

*   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should typically change to include `(venv)` at the beginning, indicating that the virtual environment is active and isolated for this project.
