7. **Data Model Best Practices (Kotlin/Android):**
   - When defining data models (e.g., data classes, entities), ensure they include:
     - A unique identifier (e.g., `id: Int` or `id: String`) for each record.
     - A timestamp or date field (e.g., `date: String` or `timestamp: Long`) for tracking creation or modification times.
   - For structured data persistence, prioritize using the Room Persistence Library over SharedPreferences for lists or complex objects.
   - For Android UI development, adopt the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern.
   - Utilize `LiveData` or Kotlin `Flow` for reactive UI updates, ensuring data consistency and responsiveness.
   - Explicitly mention these fields in the task description for data model creation.
