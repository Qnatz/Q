# FlaskQuickstart-20231027T103000

This project is a simple Flask application demonstrating basic web development concepts.

## Running and Verifying the Application

Follow these steps to run the Flask development server and verify the application's functionality:

1.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd FlaskQuickstart-20231027T103000
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (if not already done in previous steps):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Linux/macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Flask development server**:
    The `.flaskenv` file configures `FLASK_APP=app.py` and `FLASK_ENV=development`, so you can simply run:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    You should see output indicating the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5.  **Verify the Homepage**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
    *Expected Result*: You should see a page titled "Home" with content similar to "Welcome to the Homepage! This is the main page of our Flask application."

6.  **Verify the About Page**:
    While the server is still running, open a new tab or navigate in your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/about`.
    *Expected Result*: You should see a page titled "About Us" with content similar to "About This Application This is a simple Flask Quickstart application."

7.  **Stop the server**:
    Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the Flask development server is running.

8.  **Deactivate the virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
